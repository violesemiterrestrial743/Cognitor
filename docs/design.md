# Architecture

Cognitor is a defensive Windows patch-diff pipeline. It compares two snapshots, extracts evidence, identifies security-relevant semantic changes, scores findings, and emits reports for review or automation.

## Data Flow

```text
old snapshot dir      new snapshot dir
      |                    |
      v                    v
  ingest.Scan()        ingest.Scan()
      |                    |
      +------ model.Snapshot
               |
               v
        diff.SummarizeChanges()
        diff.Analyze()
               |
               v
        analysis.DefaultEngine()
               |
               v
        score.DefaultScorer()
               |
               v
        graph.Build()
        report.BuildWithMetadata()
               |
               v
        Markdown / JSON / SARIF / CSV / SQLite / bundle manifest
```

## Packages

- `cmd/cognitor`: executable entry point.
- `internal/cli`: Cobra commands and user-facing workflow orchestration.
- `internal/ingest`: snapshot scanning, PE metadata, strings, manifests, symbols, and analysis sidecars.
- `internal/diff`: binary/function matching, semantic additions, inventory change summaries, and focus filtering support.
- `internal/analysis`: composable defensive hardening rules.
- `internal/score`: severity and risk scoring.
- `internal/graph`: graph model used for triage queries.
- `internal/report`: Markdown, JSON, SARIF, CSV, executive summaries, and review queues.
- `internal/store`: SQLite persistence for snapshots, findings, graph data, and change summaries.
- `pkg/model`: stable data contracts shared across internal packages.

## Normal Workflow

Most users should run:

```sh
cognitor compare old new --workdir out --all-formats
```

This performs scanning, diffing, scoring, graph building, report generation, and bundle manifest generation in one pass.

## Advanced Workflow

The staged workflow is still available when you want to inspect intermediate databases:

```sh
cognitor scan --snapshot old --path old --out old.db
cognitor scan --snapshot new --path new --out new.db
cognitor diff --old old.db --new new.db --out findings.db
cognitor report --db findings.db --format markdown --out report.md
```

## Matching Model

Cognitor matches binaries by normalized Windows-style relative path. Matching is case-insensitive, so `System32/NTDLL.DLL` and `system32/ntdll.dll` are treated as the same target.

Functions are matched by:

- exact symbol name,
- normalized symbol name,
- semantic neighborhood similarity from strings, calls, imports, and basic block count.

Sidecar analysis files improve matching quality and finding precision.

## Snapshot Model

A snapshot contains:

- binaries such as `.exe`, `.dll`, `.sys`, `.drv`, `.ocx`, and `.cpl`,
- evidence artifacts such as `.edb`, `.dat`, `.log`, `.evtx`, `.etl`, `.reg`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.ini`, `.inf`, `.cfg`, and `.conf`,
- optional `services.json`,
- optional `registry.json`.

## Report Model

Reports include:

- run metadata,
- executive risk posture,
- beginner guidance,
- researcher checklist,
- priority review queue,
- automatic change inventory,
- scored findings,
- graph data,
- responsible-disclosure-oriented manual review plan.

## Design Principles

- Defensive only: Cognitor identifies likely hardening changes and review targets, not exploit steps.
- Evidence oriented: every finding should have supporting strings, calls, operations, imports, or artifact evidence.
- Automation friendly: JSON, SARIF, CSV, SQLite, and bundle hashes are deterministic enough for CI retention and regression review.
- Tool agnostic: disassembler integration is file based through `*.analysis.json`.
